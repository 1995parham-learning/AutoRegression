# AutoRegression
Autoregression is a **time series model** that uses observations from previous time steps 
as input to a regression equation to predict the value at the next time step. It is a very 
simple idea that can result in accurate forecasts on a range of time series problems.

The equation for the area of a circle is:

$$A = \pi r^2$$

where $r$ is the radius of the circle.
